## Tolerância a faltas
Basics: A component provides services to clients. To provide services, the component may require the services from other components => a component may depend on some other component.

# Availability A(t) of component C
Average fraction of time that C has been up-and-running in interval [0, t).
	-	Long-term availability A: A(∞)
	-	Note: A = MTTF/MTBF = MTTF/(MTTF + MTTR)

Obervation: Reliability and availability make sense only if we have an accurate notion of what a failure actually is.

# Terminology
Failure: 			A component is not living up to its specifications.
Error:				Part of a component that can lead to a failure.
Fault:				Cause of an error.
Fault prevention:	Prevent the occurrence of a fault.
Fault tolerance:	Build a component such that it can mask the occurrence of a fault.
Fault removal:		Reduce the presence, number. or seriousness of a fault.
Fault forecasting:	Estimate current presence, future incidence, and consequences of faults

<h4>Types of failures</h4>
Crash failure:		Halts, but is working correctly until it halts.
Omission failure:	Fails to respond, recieve or send messages.
Timing failures:	Response lies outside a specified time interval.
Response failure:	Response is incorrect or wrong.
Arbirtrary failure:	May produce arbitrary responses at arbitrary times.

Arbitrary failures are sometimes qualified as <b>malicious</b>
