## Security
# Introduction
Objectivos de segurança: integridade, confidencialidade, disponibilidade.

Confidentiatly refers to the propriety of a computer system whereby its information is disclosed only to authorized parties.
Integrity is the characteristic that alterations to a systems assets can be made only in an authorized way.

Sistemas monolíticos: Sistemas que não são paralelos nem distribuídos.

# Security policy
Security policy: Describes precissely which actions the entities in a system are allowed to take and which ones are prohibited.
Security mechanisms:
	- Encryption;
	- Authentication;	
	- Authorization;	
	- Auditing.			(Auditoria)

Trusted Computing Base (TCB): 
	Set of all security mechanisms in a (distributed) computer system that are needed to enforce a security policy, and thus need to be trusted. The smaller the TCT, the better.

# Secure channels
Key Distribution Center (KDC):
	shares a secret key with each of the hosts, but no pair of hosts is required to have a shared key as well.

# Firewalls
Packet-filtering gateway:
	This type of firewall operates as a router and makes decisions as to whether or not to pass a network packet based on the source and destination address as contained in the packets header.
